% GBLAB2OCT  convert lab coordinate grain boundaries to octonions
% Convert the crystal orientations (expressed as quaternions) of grains
% meeting at a grain boundary (GB) together with the corresponding GB
% normals to the GB octonion defined by Francis [1] and required by the
% GBdist function [2].

%
% NOTE: The convention used by [1] and required for proper use of the 
% GBdist function [2] is that the GB plane reference frame is defined such 
% that the GB plane lies in the zR = 0 plane, with grain A occupying zR > 0
% and grain B occupying zR < 0, which implies that the normal pointing away 
% from grain B (which we call nB, using the outward-pointing normal 
% convention) is parallel to zR. Note that this is in contrast to Olmsted's 
% convention which is that the GB plane lies in the zR = 0 plane with grain
% A occupying zR < 0 and grain B occupying zR > 0, which implies that the
% normal pointing away from grain A (which we call nA, using the
% outward-pointing normal convention) is parallel to zR. Moreover, the 
% GB5DOF function has a completely different convention, which is that the 
% GB plane reference frame is defined such that the GB plane lies in the 
% xR = 0 plane with grain A occupying xR < 0 and grain B occupying xR > 0,
% which implies that the normal pointing away from grain A (which we call
% nA, using the outward-pointing normal convention) is parallel to xR.
%
% Inputs:
%   qA_Lab - An nGB-by-4 array of quaternions representing the orientations 
%            of one of the grains at the GB (grain A). qA_Lab(i,:) 
%            represents the quaternion defining the orientation of grain A 
%            for the i-th GB. With a reference coordinate system defined 
%            such that z = 0 is the GB plane, grain A is the region z < 0.
%   qB_Lab - An nGB-by-4 array of quaternions representing the orientations 
%            of one of the grains at the GB (grain B). qB_Lab(i,:) 
%            represents the quaternion defining the orientation of grain B 
%            for the i-th GB. With a reference coordinate system defined 
%            such that z = 0 is the GB plane, grain B is the region z > 0.
%   nA_Lab - A 3-by-nGB array of 3D vectors representing the GB normals
%            expressed in the Lab coordinate system. As a convention, we
%            define nA_Lab such that it is pointing away from grain A (i.e.
%            it is the outward-pointing normal). nA_Lab(:,i) give the
%            vector representing the GB normal for the i-th GB.
%
% Outputs:
%   oAB - An nGB-by-8 array of octonions where oAB(i,:) represents the i-th
%         GB. Note that these are NOT normalized octonions, rather they are
%         composed of two normalized quaternions, so that the magnitude of
%         each octonion is sqrt(2). This is the expected format of
%         octonions used as input to GBdist.
%
% Usage:
%   oAB = GBlab2oct(qA_Lab,qB_Lab,nA_Lab,convention)
