Description of supplemental files

I.  mobility.txt

1.  The index number for the grain boundary as given in the
supplemental data for part I.  

2.  The measured mobiltity at 1400K, with a added potential energy of
0.025 eV per atom in m/sGPa.  A value of zero indicates that the
boundary did not move some minimum distance, see the text for details.
No estimate of the error is given, but at least for the larger values
not all digits are significant.


II.  shear.txt

1.  The index number for the grain boundary as given in the
supplemental data for part I.

2.  The average relative shear of the right grain, with respect to the left
grain, at 1400K.  One run in each direction for 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, and 
in some cases 0.05 eV/atom are included.  For boundaries where
any of the runs failed to move the minimum distance, "****" is shown.
    The relative shear is shown as a y-z vector in the sample 
coordinates. 
    In many cases the relative shear is very consistent from run to run
and both figures are significant, but in some cases the shear is noisy
or varies with driving force.
